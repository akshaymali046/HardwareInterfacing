# Hardware Interfacing using AVR Microcontrollers

[We @ ElementzOnline](https://www.elementzonline.com) releasing the source codes of various hardware interfacing developed by our Development Team to the public domain. 

### You can see the interfacing guides on our blog [Elementz Tech Blog](https://elementztechblog.wordpress.com/)! :+1:

The following interfacing is done:
